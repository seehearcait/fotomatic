# Project: Fotomatic

## Instructions
In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will update it to look and work exactly the same as the specs do. Download the broken [code](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/capstone_fotomatic_start.zip) here and the specs [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png). You can also see a working version of the final product here.

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
